## Hello,

SO nice to see you here in the Internet of Universe. This blog is ___bilingual___, you need to select ['English'](/en) or ['中文'](/cn) in the navigation panel to enter the website.

My name is Jun Xiong (how to [pronounce](/en/2014/10/faqs#jun) it). I am a scientist and writer. I do [scientific researches](/en/2014/10/my-projects/) to collect and evaluate facts; I write to tell people what I am thinking in my life; I swim when I can find some time beside work. You might want to check [Frequently Asked Questions](/en/2014/10/faqs) to know how you can get most from this website. While viewing my posts, you are always welcome to comment and even co-edit them through [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) by clicking this icon <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true" title="Suggest an edit of this page"></i> on the top-right corner of the post. 

<!-- , here is a [post](/) describing how it works. -->

I am an [Anti-Social Media](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carrie-kirk/why-im-antisocial-media_b_5961252.html) guy to try to survive at this  information explosion age. I keep away with emails and other social media apps since they are untrackable and fragmental, except [github](https://github.com/suredream) and wechat. To contact me, short and succinct messages via [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/suredream/suredream.github.io/issues/new) are preferred (you need a GitHub account). You can also scan following qrcode to subscribe my Official Wechat Accounts (**time_dang**, [光阴典当行](/cn)) to leave me a message. If these two didn't work, you can use [this guestbook](/guestbook) to write down what you think.

> Never stop until arrive at your destined place - that is, the unique you.

Have fun!

**Q. How to pronouce 'Jun Xiong' in Chinese?**

A. 'Jun Xiong' means 'a brave man, a good writer' in Chinese. It sounds like 'June Ceon'. You might also find 'Ceon' is also wired (it is a British name, that's why). My younger daughter, Rebecca, a preschooler, want to replace it with 'Song', since she loves singinge. So you can also follow her way.

My older daughter, Sophia, is a elementary student. She is proud of having the most difficulty name in the class. I wonder whether she will hold the same feel in the future. Hope she can be always proud of her old man.

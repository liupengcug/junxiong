## Research Interest

10+ years experience in Remote sensing and GIS, currently a research scientist in U.S. Geological Survey working on high resolution global cropland mapping.   My research focuses on global cropland mapping / changing and its interaction with limited water resources and how they affect ecosystem and food security in the future. I’ve been an NPP postdoctoral fellow at NASA Ames Research Center from 2011-2013.
